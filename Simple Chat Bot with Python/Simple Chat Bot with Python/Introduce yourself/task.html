<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality. We'll not only make our bot more interactive by asking the user for their name, but we'll also start organizing our code into functions. Functions allow us to structure our code in a way that's easier to read, maintain, and extend. As our bot grows, this will become increasingly important.</p><h5 id="objective">Objective</h5><p>In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.</p><p>Your program should print the following lines:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {your_name}!</code></pre><p>You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.</p><p>Instead of <code class="java">{your_name}</code>, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>a dialogue with the bot</em></p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
&gt; Max
What a great name you have, Max!</code></pre><p>We'll define a function called <code class="java">greet()</code> that takes the bot's name and birth year as parameters. This function will handle the initial greeting. We'll also create a function called <code class="java">remind_name()</code> that asks for the user's name and greets them personally. Moreover, we'll add F-strings and provide a more readable and concise way to include variables within strings. Instead of concatenating strings with the <code class="java">+</code> operator, you can directly embed expressions inside curly braces <code class="java">{}</code> within an f-string, making your code cleaner and easier to understand.</p><p>Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text, but not the number of printed lines.</p>
