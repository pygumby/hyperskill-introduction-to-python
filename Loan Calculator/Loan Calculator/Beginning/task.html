<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.</p><p>Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in simple terms. The principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal amount.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's start by imitating this behavior:</p><ul><li><p>Prompt the user to enter their loan principal.</p></li><li><p>Prompt the user to enter their monthly payment.</p></li><li><p>Calculate and display the number of months required to repay the loan by dividing the loan principal by the monthly payment.</p></li></ul><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that this is not part of the input.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter the loan principal:
&gt; 1000
Enter the monthly payment:
&gt; 200

It will take 5 months to repay the loan</code></pre>
