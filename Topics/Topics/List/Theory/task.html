<p>In your programs, you often need to group several elements in order to process them as a single object. For this, you will need to use different collections. One of the most important and useful collections in Python is a <strong>list</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="creating-and-printing-lists">Creating and printing lists</h5>
<p>Look at a simple list that stores several names of dogs' breeds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dog_breeds = ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']
print(dog_breeds)  # ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']</code></pre>
<p>In the first line, we use square brackets to create a list that contains four elements and then assign it to the <code class="language-python">dog_breeds</code> variable. In the second line, the list is printed through the variable's name. All the elements are printed in the same order as they were stored in the list because lists are <strong>ordered</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is another list that contains five integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></pre>
<p>Another way to create a list is to invoke the <code class="language-python">list</code> function. It is used to create a list out of an <strong>iterable</strong> object: that is, a kind of object where you can get its elements one by one. The concept of iterability will be explained in detail further on, but let's look at the examples below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">list_out_of_string = list('danger!')
print(list_out_of_string)  # ['d', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'r', '!']

list_out_of_integer = list(235)  # TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable</code></pre>
<p>So, the <code class="language-python">list</code> function creates a list containing each element from the given <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5979" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an iterable object is a collection of data that can be looped over and its elements accessed one by one. | Iterables include common data structures such as lists, strings, and dictionaries. They implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an iterator object that can be used to access the elements of the iterable. An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and implements the `__next__()` method, which returns the next item of the iterable. Once an iterator has returned all the elements of an iterable, it cannot be reset or reused.">iterable object</a>. For now, remember that a <strong>string </strong>is an example of an <strong>iterable </strong>object, and an <strong>integer </strong>is an example of a <strong>non-iterable</strong> object. A <strong>list </strong>itself is also an <strong>iterable </strong>object.</p>
<p>Let's also note the difference between the <code class="language-python">list</code> function and creating a list using <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5979" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, square brackets are used to access elements in a sequence such as lists or strings by their index. | The index of the first element is 0, and indexing starts from left to right. It is important to note that the index must be within the range of the sequence, otherwise, it will result in an error. Additionally, square brackets are also used in set data type to define a set of unique elements.">square brackets</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">multi_element_list = list('danger!')
print(multi_element_list)  # ['d', 'a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'r', '!']

single_element_list = ['danger!']
print(single_element_list)  # ['danger!']</code></pre>
<p>The square brackets and the <code class="language-python">list</code> function can also be used to create <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5979" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an empty list is a list object that does not have any elements in it. | It can be represented as [] or by using the list() function with no argument. An empty list is different from a regular list, which contains one or more elements. An empty list is still a list object, it just doesn't have any elements in it. An empty list is a type of non-empty sequence, and it is equivalent to other non-empty sequences in certain contexts. An empty list will not return a value for functions where false values are present, unlike a list with false values.">empty lists</a></strong> that do not have elements at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">empty_list_1 = list()
empty_list_2 = []</code></pre>
<p>In the following topics, we will consider how to fill empty lists.</p>
<h5 id="features-of-lists">Features of lists</h5>
<p>Lists can<strong> </strong>store <strong>duplicate values</strong> as many times as needed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">on_off_list = ['on', 'off', 'on', 'off', 'on']
print(on_off_list)  # ['on', 'off', 'on', 'off', 'on']</code></pre>
<p>Another important thing about lists is that they can contain <strong>different types</strong> of elements, including other lists. So there are neither restrictions nor fixed list types, and you can add any data you want to your list, as in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">different_objects = ['a', 1, 'b', 2, [1, 2, 3]]</code></pre>
<h5 id="length-of-a-list">Length of a list</h5>
<p>Sometimes you need to know how many elements there are in a list. There is a built-in function called <code class="language-python">len()</code> that can be applied to any <strong>iterable</strong> object, and it simply returns the <strong>length</strong> of that object.</p>
<p>So, when applied to a list, it returns the number of elements in that list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(numbers))  # 5

empty_list = list()
print(len(empty_list))  # 0

single_element_list = ['danger!']
print(len(single_element_list))  # 1

multi_elements_list = list('danger!')
print(len(multi_elements_list))  # 7</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, you can see how the <code class="language-python">len()</code> function works. Again, pay attention to the difference between <code class="language-python">list()</code> and <code class="language-python">[]</code> as applied to strings: it may not result in what you expected.</p>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>As a recap, we note that lists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ordered</strong>, i.e. each element has a fixed position in a list;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>iterable</strong>, i.e. you can get their elements one by one;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to store <strong>duplicate values</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>able to store <strong>different types of elements;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>besides being used for creating an empty list, the<strong> </strong><code class="language-python">list()</code> function also can be used to make a list out of an iterable object.</p>
