<p>Computer science, like any other science, actually, has lots of theory attached to it. It never hurts to be familiar with some fundamental theoretical knowledge about a programming language you're learning or already using in practice. It might help you to understand the language better or the difference between several ones. In this topic, we'll learn some theory about types in Python and see how it works in practice.</p>

For instance, you can store an integer in a variable, and then later store a string in the same variable. This is different from statically typed languages, where the type of a variable is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program. An example of statically typed languages are C++, Java, and Go. In Python, dynamic typing allows you to store several values of different types in a single variable during your code execution and no error will occur. On the other hand, in statically typed languages, each variable has a type that cannot be changed during runtime, so the equivalent code would fail. Strong typing, which is related to dynamic typing, means that implicit type conversion does not happen.

There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operations</a> you need to change its type to an integer or another numerical type.

This means that you can store several values of different types in a single variable during code execution and no error will occur. Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable can change over the course of a program's execution. Python is also strongly typed, meaning that implicit type conversion does not occur. For example, even though a string may consist only of digits, it is still a string.">type system</a></strong>, such value could be interpreted as an integer to successfully perform the operation. Such behavior, when one of the operands is implicitly converted to the type of another operand, is called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, type coercion refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another, allowing two operands of different types to be combined in an expression. | However, Python does not perform type coercion implicitly, unlike some other programming languages. For instance, if you try to use a string (which consists only of digits) in an arithmetic operation, you will get a type error. This is because Python has a strongly typed system, meaning that a value's type is fixed and cannot be changed once it is assigned.">type coercion</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Since there is no type coercion in Python, the same operand may give different results depending on the types of provided arguments. For example, you can add two strings to get a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. | This is typically done using the `+` operator. For example, if we have the strings `Hello` and `World`, we can concatenate them to get the string `HelloWorld`. Concatenation can also be done with string formatting, such as `Hello {}.format(World)`. It is important to note that concatenation can also occur when using certain string methods, such as the `join()` method, which concatenates a list of strings using a specified delimiter.">concatenation</a>. It is also possible to multiply a string by an integer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(125 + 125)  #  250

print("125" + "125")  # "125125"

print(125 * 4)  # 500

print("125" * 4)  # "125125125125"

print("This is a number:", 125)  # "This is a number: 125"</code></pre>
<p>The example also shows that you can print values of different types if you separate them with commas in the parentheses. The <code class="language-python">print()</code> function will print all the arguments delimited by a space.</p>
<h5 id="explicit-type-casting">Explicit type casting</h5>
<p>The process of converting a value to another type is also called <strong>type casting</strong>. Though implicit type casting is almost not allowed in Python you will often find yourself in need to define an explicit <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, type conversion is the process of converting a value of one data type to another data type, also known as type casting. | Python is a strongly typed language, which means that type conversion must be done explicitly. For instance, if you have a string that consists only of digits and you want to use it in an arithmetic operation, you need to change its type to an integer or another numerical type. Type casting is often used for debugging purposes or when working with user input. For example, if you have a string that you want to convert to an integer, you can use the int() function.">type conversion</a> within your code. This happens a lot when you work with the user's input.</p>
<p>Imagine you are adding two numbers, one of which has <code class="language-python">int</code> type and the other has a <code class="language-python">float</code> type. In this case, during the addition operation, <code class="language-python">int</code> type will be converted to <code class="language-python">float</code>, but the variable itself will not change its type. This example is shown in the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 5
print(type(a))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;

b = 0.7
print(type(b)) # &lt;class 'float'&gt;

c = a + b
print(type(c)) # &lt;class 'float'&gt;

print(a, type(a)) # 5 &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you asked a user to provide an age that you will later use in some calculations. To convert a string to integer type you can use the built-in <code class="language-python">int()</code> function. This is an example of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, explicit type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another data type using built-in functions. | This is often necessary when working with user input or when different data types need to be combined in calculations.

<pre><code class="language-python">raw_age = "22"
print(type(raw_age))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;

age = int(raw_age)
print(type(age))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-python">type</code> function is used to find out the type of the value provided.</p>
<p>To cast an integer to the string type use the <code class="language-python">str()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">age = 22
print(type(age))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;

string_age = str(age)
print(type(string_age))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you noticed, to cast a value to some type we use the function with the same name. If conversion between two types is not allowed you will see an error. Except for the <code class="language-python">str()</code> and <code class="language-python">int()</code> functions we covered above there is also a <code class="language-python">float()</code> function. It converts a given value to the float type.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples of casting between different types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f = 3.14  # the type is float
print(type(f))  # &lt;class 'float'&gt;

s = str(f)  # converting float to string
print(type(s))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;

i = int(f)  # while converting a float value to an integer its fractional part is discarded
print(i)  # 3
print(type(i))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;

f = float(i)
print(f)  # 3.0
print(type(f))  # &lt;class 'float'&gt;</code></pre>

<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>This topic explores the nature of Python's type system, highlighting that it is both dynamically typed and strongly typed. Dynamic typing means that variables do not have fixed types and can change type at runtime, unlike <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, static typing is a concept that refers to a system where the type of a variable is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed during runtime. | This is different from dynamically typed languages, like Python, where the type of a variable is determined during runtime based on the value it holds. In a statically typed language, each variable has a type that cannot be changed, so trying to store a value of a different type in the same variable would result in an error. Statically typed languages include C++, Java, and Go.">static typing</a> where types are checked at compile-time. Strong typing ensures that operations on incompatible types result in errors, preventing unintended type coercion, as opposed to weak typing which allows implicit type conversions. Python also supports explicit type casting, allowing developers to manually convert data types to ensure the desired type compatibility and behavior.</p>
