<ol><li><p><strong>Printing several </strong><strong>lines</strong><strong>:</strong> The <code class="java">print()</code> function is not just for printing one line â€“ it's a versatile tool for creating <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47555" target="_blank" title="In Python, a multi-line refers to a string that spans across multiple lines. | This can be achieved using either a single or double quote, and the backslash symbol can be used to escape the newline character within a single or double-quoted string. Alternatively, a multi-line string can be created using a triple quote, which allows for a more readable and quicker way to print multiple lines with a single function call. This is particularly useful when printing several lines of output or leaving comments in the code for other developers to follow.">multi-line</a> output in our Python programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Making spaces:</strong> Using the <code class="java">print()</code> function without anything inside the parentheses will leave an empty line.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being Quick:</strong> Triple quotes or <code class="java">\n</code> can be used to print multiple lines with a single <code class="java">print()</code> function call.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using comments:</strong> We can leave little notes in our code using <code class="java">#</code>, kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for others to follow.</p></li></ol>
