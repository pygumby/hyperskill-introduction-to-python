<p>In Python, operators are fundamental tools for performing various operations on data. Two operators that offer unique functionalities are the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47917" target="_blank" title="In Python, a modulus operator is a type of integer arithmetic operation that calculates the remainder of a division operation. | For example, when 7 is divided by 3, the result is 2 with a remainder of 1. This is denoted by the % symbol. The modulus operator is useful for a variety of programming tasks, such as determining if a number is even or odd, or getting the last digit of a number. It's also important to understand the precedence of operators in Python, as it determines the order in which operations are performed.">modulus operator</a> <code class="java">%</code> and the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47917" target="_blank" title="In Python, the exponentiation operator is a special symbol used for raising a number to a power. | It is represented by two asterisks (`**`). For example, `2**3` would result in `8`, as it represents 2 raised to the power of 3. The exponentiation operator has higher precedence than multiplication, division, and modulo, but lower precedence than parentheses. Understanding the precedence of operators is crucial for determining the order in which operations are performed. By mastering the usage and precedence of the exponentiation operator and other operators, you can effectively and efficiently manipulate data in Python.">exponentiation operator</a> <code class="java">**</code>.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Modulus Operator (%):</strong> This operator calculates the remainder of a division operation. For example, <code class="java">7 % 3</code> returns <code class="java">1</code>, as 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exponentiation Operator (**)</strong>: This operator raises a number to a power. For instance, <code class="java">2 ** 3</code> results in <code class="java">8</code>, as 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.</p></li></ul>
<p>Understanding the precedence of operators is crucial for determining the order in which operations are performed. In Python, the precedence hierarchy is as follows (from highest to lowest precedence):</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Parentheses &gt; Exponentiation &gt; Multiplication = Division = Integer Division = Modulo &gt; Addition = Subtraction</p></div>
<p>Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and force operations to occur in a specific order.</p>
<p>By mastering the usage and precedence of these operators, you gain the ability to manipulate data effectively and efficiently in Python.</p>
